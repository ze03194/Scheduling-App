Appointment Scheduling Desktop Application

The purpose of this application is to provide users with an interactive GUI for an appointment scheduling application. Users have the ability to perform
CRUD operations on the mySQL database using interactive buttons, selectors, input fields, etc.. 

To run the program, the user will be prompted with a login screen and verify the user. If the user is verified, they are then taken to an initial LoggedIn screen with 
a variety of buttons in a button bar to select from. Each button corresponds to a table in the database. Selecting one of the buttons will allow the user to 
perform desired CRUD operations on that table.
